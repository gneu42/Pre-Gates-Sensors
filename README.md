# **Pre-Gates-Sensors**

### **This is an alternative to the pre-gate cottontail version.**

**It is composed of:**
  * printed rail that is hooked up at the bottom of the ERCF V2 by 2 arms. This can also be a 2020 extrusion. The rail is designed for 13 gates + bypass, But can be cut in the slicer to the needed length. The bypass position can be anywhere.
  * the back side of the rail gives the possibility to hook up a small box that can receive a PI Pico in case the MCU does not have enough inputs for the Pre-Gate switches.
  * The back side of the rail gives also the possibility to attach the wires with tie wraps.
  * on top of the rail, comes the Pre_Gate sensor guides
  * in the guides, the Pre_Gate sensor body can slide freely in.

**The Pre_Gate Sensor body.**

  * This pregate sensor fixes the false triggering issue present in the other Pre-Gate sensor known to date.
  * the ball is at 90Â° instead at of bellow the filament. Thus the ball can't see the notch ground in the filament by "bad" load.unload. This makes it more reliable.
  * The switch is installed with its lever, and therefore, the trigger point can be adjusted by bending the lever a little bit.
